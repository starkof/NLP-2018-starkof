# Naive Bayes Classifier

* Data to train this classifier is contained in the _sentiment labelled sentences_ folder.

* Each .txt file contains a thousand labelled reviews from Amazon(amazon_cells_labelled.txt), Yelp(yelp_labelled.txt) and IMDB
(imdb_labelled.txt). Ensure that these files are in the same directory as the classifier.

* In the same folder, the file _check.txt_ has been provided to apply the classifier on.

* In command line, call the command 'python my_naive_bayes.py check.txt' to view results of the classifier.
