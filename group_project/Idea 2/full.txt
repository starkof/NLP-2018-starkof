In these situations, dealers and salespeople are so motivated to close a sale that they will let some new cars go with little-or-no profit in the deal.	Cars

No, there are no laws giving you a "three day right to cancel" or any kind of cooling-off period that would permit you to return a car that you bought. However, if the dealer puts that language in your contract (most dealers won't), then it might be possible. Just remember: if something you want is not in writing, you're probably not going to get it.	Cars
Is the dealer invoice price the real dealer cost on new cars?	163.	The dealer invoice price is NOT the real dealer cost on a new car or truck.

Does putting extra air in the tires help a car cope with carrying extra weight?	181.	Definitely. When tires are cold, add five pounds to the pressures recommended by your car's manufacturer.

Should you turn your car off when stopped for extended periods?	182.	A car engine shouldn't be left idling unnecessarily for more than a minute. It takes less fuel to start a car than it takes to let it idle while waiting, say, for a long freight train to pass.	Cars
How long should you warm up an engine before winter driving?	183.	An engine shouldn't idle for more than 15 to 30 seconds in any season, especially if it's fuel-injected.	Cars
Are today's cars really better than the ones built in the 1950s?	184.	The old models were more colorful and simpler to fix. But they were fuel-guzzling, overweight polluters that didn't stay in tune as long as modern cars. Also, while most 1950s cars rarely exceeded 100,000 miles without lots of maintenance and gentle driving, even low-priced 1990s autos are routinely driven far more than 100,000 miles with minimal maintenance. They're also safer, with items such as air bags, advanced safety belt systems, anti-lock brakes and "crush" zones that let the car--not its occupants--absorb the impact in collisions. Being lighter and more efficient, they're faster with a V-6 than most of the old V-8s.	Cars
Does it matter where you buy gasoline?	185.	Buy gasoline at busy stations to ensure you don't get a "bad load" that has been sitting too long in a tank. Also, don't buy gas at a station at the same time you see a delivery truck filling an underground tank--and stirring up impurities in the fuel in that tank.	Cars
Why is test driving a car important?	186.	While window shopping is a good way to get started on your car buying journey, the only way to get the best feel for a vehicle is to get behind the wheel for a test drive.	Cars

My car won't hold a straight line without corrections from me. Is something wrong?	190.	Your vehicle should be able to travel in a straight line without corrective action from you when the steering wheel is in the proper position. If it can't, your automobile may be out of alignment.	Cars

What are the advantages to leasing a car?	197.	Leasing a new Toyota sedan or a new luxury SUV has several advantages. If you like the idea of driving a new car every few years, don't drive a lot of miles per year (12,000 or less), don't relish the idea of trading in or selling a vehicle after your purchase it, then leasing at our car dealership in Indianapolis, IN makes a lot of sense.	Cars
Should I be concerned about the quality of pre-owned cars?	198.	Not at all.

How do I use Alexa?	1. Alexa allows you to ask questions and make requests using just your voice. For instance, you can ask Alexa a question, such as "What is the weather today in New York?", or tell Alexa to do something, like "Add batteries to my shopping list," or "Play jazz." When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to Amazon's cloud so we can process and respond to your request. You access Alexa differently based on the type of device you are using. For "hands free" devices, like the Amazon Echo, you access Alexa by saying the wake word (Alexa, Echo, Amazon, or Computer). For other devices, like certain Fire tablets, you access Alexa by pressing a button.	Alexa
What happens when I speak to Alexa?	2. When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to Amazon�s cloud where we process your request and other information to respond to you. For example, when you ask �Alexa, play top hits on Amazon Music� we use the recording of your request and information from Amazon Music to play top hits.	Alexa
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?	3. No. Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (Alexa, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button).	Alexa
Can I review and delete my voice recordings?	4. Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and delete those voice recordings one by one or all at once by visiting Privacy in Settings in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy . You can also review those voice recordings by visiting History in Settings in the Alexa app and delete those voice recordings all at once for each of your Alexa-enabled products by visiting Manage Your Content and Devices. Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you delete voice recordings, we will also remove Home Screen Cards in the Alexa app related to those voice recordings. However, removing a Home Screen Card from your Alexa app does not delete voice recordings. If you have changed your default marketplace while using an Alexa-enabled product, you will need to perform this step for each marketplace to delete all voice recordings associated with your account. Note that deleting your voice recordings does not remove your Alexa messages. For more information on removing messages, refer to the FAQ "How do I remove messages?"	Alexa
How are my voice recordings used?	5. Alexa uses your voice recordings and other information, including from third-party services, to answer your questions, fulfil your requests, and improve your experience and our services. We associate your requests with your Amazon account to allow you to review your voice recordings, access other Amazon services (e.g., so you can ask Alexa to read your Kindle books and play audiobooks from Audible), and to provide you with a more personalized experience. For example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps Alexa choose what songs to play when you say, �Alexa, play music.� At times, Alexa may make recommendations to you based on your requests. For example, Alexa may recommend Alexa skills you might like based on the Alexa skills you use.	Alexa
How do my voice recordings improve Alexa?	6. Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. The more you use Alexa, the more the service adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences. For example, we use your requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems. The more data we use to train these systems, the better Alexa works, and training Alexa with voice recordings from a diverse range of customers helps ensure Alexa works well for everyone. You can also help us improve our voice services by providing feedback within History in the Alexa app.	Alexa
How do Alexa skills work?	7. Skills are voice-driven Alexa capabilities. You can view and enable skills in your Alexa app and enable certain skills by voice. You can use a skill by saying a specific phrase, called the invocation name. When you use a skill, we may exchange related information with the developer of that skill, such as your answers when you play a trivia skill, your ZIP code when you ask for the weather, or the content of your requests. If you make a request to Alexa without using a skill invocation name, we may send the content of your request to several skills, and enable and launch the skill we think is best able to respond to your request. The Skills portion of your Alexa app contains more information about skills, such as applicable policies or terms of use provided by skill developers.	Alexa
How does voice purchasing work?	8. Prime members can ask Alexa to order or reorder eligible products available for sale through the Amazon website.

You can require a speakable confirmation code, turn purchasing off, and see product and order details in your Alexa app or at https://alexa.amazon.comfor those orders. Just like orders placed through the Amazon website, orders placed through Alexa are subject to Amazon's Conditions of Use and Privacy Notice in the case of a subscription for a service, the terms for the applicable service. Voice purchasing from Amazon is turned off for FreeTime on Alexa. Some Alexa skills allow you to purchase non-digital products or services from the developer of the skill (for instance, order food through a restaurant's skill) via Amazon Pay using your default payment and shipping settings. You can view your Amazon Pay order history and find additional information for those purchases on the Amazon Pay website. Some other Alexa skills allow you to purchase products and services from the developer of the skill using a payment method you provide directly to the developer. Your voice purchasing settings may not apply to those purchases.	Alexa
Can I turn off voice purchasing?	9. Yes, Alexa has voice purchasing settings. Open Settings > Voice Purchasing in your Alexa app to turn off voice purchasing from Amazon. You can also require an optional confirmation code that Alexa will ask you to say out loud when you want to place an order from Amazon.	Alexa
What are the return and cancellation policies for products and content I order using Alexa?	10. For information on return policies applicable to non-digital products purchased on Amazon using Alexa, see About Our Returns Policies. Amazon's return policies do not apply to purchases of non-digital products or services made through third-party Alexa skills (for instance, a food order placed through a restaurant's skill). Instead, the returns policy of the applicable skill developer applies. However, the Amazon Pay A-to-z Guarantee covers qualified purchases of physical products made through third-party Alexa skills using Amazon Pay. Purchases of digital content are final. However, if you accidentally purchase digital content or a subscription to a non-Amazon service through Alexa, that purchase is eligible for return and refund if we receive your request within 7 days of the date of purchase. To request a refund, please contact customer service. You may cancel the auto-renewal of a subscription to a non-Amazon service by visiting the detail page for the applicable Alexa skill in your Alexa app and adjusting your subscription settings; you will not receive a refund of any fees already paid. For subscriptions to Amazon services, see the terms of use for the applicable subscription for information on refund eligibility and cancellation terms.	Alexa
How do voice donations work?	11. Alexa also allows you to donate to eligible charities by voice. When you make a donation, Amazon Pay will process the donation using your default Amazon payment settings and will share your name, address, and email with the charity. Your voice purchasing settings apply to donations. If you accidentally make a donation through Alexa or donate to the wrong charity, please contact customer service. You can see details of your donation in your Alexa app or at https://alexa.amazon.com.	Alexa
What is a kid skill and how do I give or revoke permission to use kid skills?	12. Kid skills are skills that have been identified by the developer as directed to children under age 13. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we require permission from a parent before kid skills can be used. You'll be asked to give permission the first time you attempt to use a kid skill. After you've given permission, you will receive a confirmation e-mail. You can review or change permissions by visiting the Manage Parental Consent page on Amazon.com or by contacting Customer Service ( https://www.amazon.com/contact-us). To learn more, please visit our Children's Privacy Disclosure.	Alexa
How does Alexa work with smart home devices?	13. Alexa enables you to control and check the status of a variety of smart home devices, such as lights, switches, cameras and thermostats. See compatible smart home devices . You can connect compatible smart home devices to Alexa using Alexa smart home skills. You can also directly connect certain smart home devices to Echo devices with a built-in smart home hub like Echo Plus. We may automatically update the firmware for certain devices on behalf of the applicable manufacturer. We may receive information about third-party smart home devices you connect to Alexa, such as device type, name, features, and status and usage history. You can delete Alexa�s status and usage history for third-party smart home devices through the Manage Smart Home Device History tab of the Privacy Settings in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy . Deleting this history may degrade your Alexa experience and certain features, such as Hunches. This will not delete other information about your smart home devices, such as device type or name.	Alexa
How does automatic voice recognition and voice profiles work?	14. Alexa can automatically recognize the voices of users in your household over time to improve personalization of certain Alexa features. You can also create a voice profile, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When Alexa recognizes your voice automatically, or when you create a voice profile, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics. Alexa stores these acoustic models in the cloud. If a user stops using Alexa and their voice is not recognized for three years, we will automatically delete the acoustic model for their voice. You can turn off automatic voice recognition or delete any voice profile you've created in the Alexa app. Automatic voice recognition is not available in certain locations.	Alexa

If you select Echo Connect, your home phone service will be used to place all calls and your home phone number will be displayed as caller ID.	Alexa
I have an Echo Connect but also use Alexa Calling. How will my call to an Alexa contact be processed?	50. If you want to call another Alexa Calling and Messaging user, there are a few different ways your call may be processed. If you specify just the name of the person you would like to call (e.g. "Alexa, call Mum"), Alexa will default to placing the call through Alexa Calling to mom's supported Echo devices or the Alexa app. If you specify the name of the person and their phone type (e.g. "Alexa, call Mum's mobile") Alexa will place the call to mom's mobile using your home phone service through your Echo Connect. For more information, see the above FAQ "What's the difference between Alexa Calling and Echo Connect."	Alexa
Can I call emergency services with Echo Connect?	51. Yes, calling emergency services as 999 or 112 through Echo Connect works just like dialling any other phone number. Simply say, "Alexa, call 999�. Please note that if Echo Connect is used to call emergency numbers like 999, the location information given to the emergency service, if any, may be the address associated with the phone line connected to your Echo Connect, which may not be the same as the location of your Echo device from which you are making the call. Echo Connect will not function in the event of a power or broadband outage or other connectivity issues. If you are unable to place your call through your Echo Connect, you should use your mobile, landline telephone, or other telephone service.	Alexa

Google and Gmail
Why am I receiving e-mail to an address similar to my own?	Gmail ignores both dots "." and caps in both account creation and e-mail delivery.  That means first.last@, firstlast@, and First.Last@ all represent the same account.  If you receive e-mail intended for someone else then either the sender accidentally used the wrong e-mail address, or they were given the wrong e-mail address.	Google and Gmail
Why am I receiving e-mail addressed to an address different than mine?	If you receive e-mail intended for someone else using an address with different characters or numbers in the address, it could be because your address is in the BCC field (very common for spam) or because the receiver made an error in auto-forwarding sending them to the wrong account.	Google and Gmail
My account may have been accessed by someone else, how to I secure it?	In order to fully secure your account you must check both your Gmail account settings (Gmail Security Checklist) and your Google account settings (Account Security Checkup).	Google and Gmail

I can't set up a Send Mail As address in Gmail for my non-Google email account.	For all non-Google email accounts you must ask your other provider for the SMTP Server name, port number and security setting they require you to use, and enter that information in the set-up boxes. If your "other account" is only a forwarding address and has no entitlement to use an SMTP server, then you cannot set it up as a Send Mail As address in Gmail	Google and Gmail
How do I make sure that all contacts on my phone get synced to my Google account and can be recovered if I lose them from the phone?	To sync to your Google account when Sync Contacts is turned on, all contacts created on your phone must be tagged with the Google contact type. Some phones provide this as the default - others, notably Samsung, require you to select the Google contact type every time. If you do not do that, then the contact will only be saved on your phone, will not sync to your Google account, and will be lost if you reset your phone or change phones. 	Google and Gmail
Why can't I get or send my Gmail messages with my Outlook/Thunderbird/Apple Mail/Windows Mail clients? I get an error message.	Gmail recently enforced a higher security sign in procedure no longer using OAuth as the default access method. While developers have received warning from Google, not all e-mail clients and apps have been updated to use the new protocol. To allow your email client apps to continue to sign in to Gmail the old way, you need to turn on access for these "Less secure Apps" in your Gmail security settings.	Google and Gmail

When you sign up for a Google Account, Search History is automatically enabled. You can turn search history on or off at any time. To view, control, and delete your saved activity, visit My Activity.	Google and Gmail
How can I remove information about myself from Google's search results?	Google search results are a reflection of the content publicly available on the web. Search engines can't remove content directly from websites, so removing search results from Google wouldn't remove the content from the web. If you want to remove something from the web, you should contact the webmaster of the site the content is posted on and ask him or her to make a change. Once the content has been removed and Google has noted the update, the information will no longer appear in Google's search results.	Google and Gmail
Are my search queries sent to websites when I click on Google Search results?	In some cases, yes. When you click on a search result in Google Search, your web browser also may send the Internet address, or URL, of the search results page to the destination webpage as the Referrer URL. The URL of the search results page may sometimes contain the search query you entered. If you are using SSL Search (Google's encrypted search functionality), under most circumstances, your search terms will not be sent as part of the URL in the Referrer URL. There are some exceptions to this behaviour, such as if you are using some less popular browsers. More information on SSL Search can be found here. Search queries or information contained in the Referrer URL may be available via Google Analytics or an application programming interface (API). In addition, advertisers may receive information relating to the exact keywords that triggered an ad click.	Google and Gmail
How do I Update Google Chrome?	Normally updates happen in the background when you close and reopen your computer's browser.

What is the Internet of Everything? 	The Internet of Everything is the intelligent connection of people, process, data and things.	Internet of Things 
Why is the Internet of Everything important? 	The Internet of Everything brings together people, process, data and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than  ever before - turning information into actions that create new  capabilities, richer experiences and unprecedented economic opportunity  for businesses, individuals and countries.	Internet of Things 
How does the Internet of Everything relate to the Internet of Things? 	The “Internet of Everything” builds on the foundation of the "Internet of Things" by adding network intelligence that allows convergence, orchestration and visibility across previously disparate systems.	Internet of Things 
Why is the Internet of Everything happening now? 	The explosion of new connections joining the Internet of Everything is driven by the development of IP-enabled devices, the increase in global broadband availability and the advent of IPv6.	Internet of Things 
What risks and challenges should be considered in the Internet of Everything? 	Some important considerations in the Internet of Everything include privacy, security, energy consumption and network congestion.	Internet of Things 
What role does the network play in the Internet of Everything? 	The network plays a critical role in the Internet of Everything – it must provide an intelligent, manageable, secure infrastructure that can scale to support billions of context-aware devices.	Internet of Things 
How does the Internet of Everything relate to our new brand campaign? 	The Internet of Everything represents the business opportunity that the new brand campaign addresses. It is not the company vision or tagline.	Internet of Things 
What is the current state of security in IoT products on the consumer scale, such as household appliances, wearables, smart-home systems, etc.? 	There is plenty of room for improvement.Smart watches: A recent HP study revealed security and privacy issues in all of the top 10 smart watch brands. Issues include lack of transport encryption, automatic connectivity to any Bluetooth device within range, and problems with lock down screens. Smart home systems: These systems show many problems, including not encrypting data and having weak password policies. Smart TVs: Some brands leave data vulnerable in transit. For example, in 2015, researchers discovered some Samsung smart TVs were sending unencrypted voice recognition data and text information.  All of these connected devices share data with mobile phones and tablets and are often programmed to automatically connect to any Bluetooth or Wi-Fi network. And, anytime a device is connected to a "public" network, there are risks involved (e.g., data theft and sabotage). This automatic connection feature makes these devices vulnerable when connecting to any "public" network.	Internet of Things 
Why are there such poor security practices in IoT products? 	Lack of understanding and devotion to good security protocols.Many IoT devices lack the computing power of a desktop or laptop computer, or other higher-end devices, which makes it difficult to implement strong security. A cultural divide exists between InfoSec professionals (those concerned with keeping the communications between devices secure), and mechanical and electrical engineers (those concerned with the switches, motors, etc., making sure the devices operate). InfoSec as an industry needs to do a better job of reaching out to build relationships with the engineers, and better demonstrate the value of security more effectively to bridge that cultural divide.	Internet of Things 
How do we best address the technical challenges impacting security for the IoT? 	The security industry can do this in several ways, but it starts with recognizing the problems and then providing better education about the solutions. In most cases, the technology is available and just needs to be implemented. For example, SSL/TLS provides strong and scalable encryption at the scale that the IoT demands. Sophisticated, managed PKI systems can handle strong identity vetting and provide reliable data encryption across all objects and devices within IoT deployments. A PKI solution should be the standard for IoT. The security industry needs to help vendors understand the risks associate with poor IoT security. First, we need to present information from the point-of-view of an end-user. Second, organizations need to be made aware of the financial impact of poor security: lowered sales, diminished trust in their brand, or even health and safety risks when healthcare devices, critical infrastructure, and national defense are included in the conversation. Simple protections can be put in place that notify end-users to set up controls over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, enabling lock screens, and other basic security functions.	Internet of Things 
How can an organization implement a trusted IoT security framework? 	An organization needs to choose a Certificate Authority partner that is trusted and can scale effectively to meet their IoT requirements.	Internet of Things 
How is the private key generated? 	During manufacturing the private key is placed directly on the device by its own cryptographic library, or by a hub/controller as close to the device as possible.	Internet of Things 
If the private key is generated "on-device", then how many lines of code need to be written by the developer (approximately)? 	Scripting OpenSSL to create certificate signing requests (CSRs) based on a few pieces of input could be done with less than 10 lines of code.	Internet of Things 
If the private key is generated "off-device", then how many lines code need to be written by the developer (approximately)? 	It can range from 50 to 1,000 lines of code across the various devices that need encrypted communications.	Internet of Things 
How is the private key stored and protected? 	Typically, it is stored on the device using Operating System (OS) access controls; otherwise, it's stored in a FIPS-compliant HSM.	Internet of Things 
Is storing the private key in hardware an option? 	Yes, the private key can be stored in hardware.	Internet of Things 
Does the private key ever have to be off-device? 	No, the private key should be stored on-device.	Internet of Things 
What languages are supported? 	SCEP, EST, RESTful API (JSON or XML).	Internet of Things 
How is the device seeded with a unique identifier? 	The device is seeded during manufacturing or during the device enrollment process.	Internet of Things 
How does an IoT provider initially seed the device? 	Ideally, the IoT provider uses a crypto engine on device to create the private key, making sure to use a strong random number generator to create the private key.	Internet of Things 
How does an IoT provider re-seed a device? 	The IoT provider use the same process as was initially used to seed the device.	Internet of Things 
How does an IoT provider revoke a certificate? 	Revocations are managed through an online interface/API call. The revocation must be submitted for a specific serial number or certificate ID.	Internet of Things 
How does an IoT provider manage which systems are trusted? 	The device management console should set access rules and controls for systems, devices, certificates, and their connections.	Internet of Things 
How does an IoT provider update the list of trusted systems securely? 	The customer uses authenticated and/or signed messaging to and from devices based on the current trust status of certificates in use on those systems.	Internet of Things 
What are the options for lengths of certificate expiration? 	Certificate expiration lengths are based on the project needs.	Internet of Things 
Can certificates be automatically provisioned and enrolled? 	Yes, certificates can be automatically provisioned and enrolled.	Internet of Things 
Approximately how many lines of code need to be written by the developer to ensure software package integrity? 	Signing verification is straightforward, so probably less than 200 lines of code (given necessary libraries are present).	Internet of Things 
Approximately how many lines of code need to be written by the developer for device-to-application secured communication? 	This would depend on the communication method and available libraries, but for something like MQTT, probably less than 200 lines of code.	Internet of Things 
Will IoT actually work over the internet or will it have its own dedicated wide area network 	Interoperability between various wireless and networking standards is still an issue and something that forums and standards bodies are trying to address.	Internet of Things 
What effect will the internet of things (IoT) have on our daily lives? 	It already is having an impact. A recent report from Gartner says there will be 4.9bn connected things in 2015, rising to 25bn by 2020.	Internet of Things 
What type of algorithms are needed for IoT?  	IoT is not about a single algorithm. There are literally thousands of algorithms that are in common use. It all depends on what you want to do. A relatively simple IoT application may end up using dozens of algorithms. A good book to get a feeling is the classic by Knuth titled: The Art of Computer Programming.	Internet of Things 
Will there be a different IP address allocation strategy for IoT devices?  	Theoretically, IPV6 has enough address space to allow IoT devices to be covered by a common construct, providing a path to consistency and inter-operability. That does not mean that each IoT node is on the internet, and some deployments are architected to aggregate IoT nodes using non-IP protocols at an internet gateway. There is a very wide range of opinions on how to do this and is part of the learning curve.	Internet of Things 
How much data is used by IOT solutions?  	There are solutions in the IoT landscape that are not very data intensive: it could be as little as one bit (is something on or off). On the other hand, it could be astronomical: think of a high-resolution camera that is producing a streaming video where you record all the bits, and then think of many such cameras producing data at the same time. Think of a major satellite system such as NASA's EOS (Earth Observing System) that has high-resolution instruments streaming high-resolution data.	Internet of Things 
How much power will IOT devices consume?  	There is no monolithic IoT. A single instance may consume a small fraction of a watt. A single cloud rack in an IoT Data Center might consume 30-60KW. Meanwhile, a large robot or autonomous machine like an agricultural combine may consume more than 100KW. The aggregate in power consumption from 50 billion IoT devices might be considerable! A good exercise is to go through and compare IoT power usage to other sources of consumption.	Internet of Things 
How well is security developed in IoT? Especially the low power devices? Are there any security architectures and algorithms developed? And what are the difficulties in implementing security in IoT?  	Security is recognized as a challenge. Regulatory bodies are mandating that security or privacy must be built in from the scratch - but that's hardly realistic. My own view is that we are on a learning curve and security is one of the items we have to conquer - that does not mean it will impede deployment, but it will impact design and applications especially for critical functions.	Internet of Things 
With the vast array of data generated by IoT technologies, how will this be impacted by the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)?  	It will have quite an impact because it will dictate where the infrastructure is located, as well as who has access to it. The ability to do things from anywhere at any time will be restricted. It is an example where non-technical issues have real consequences.	Internet of Things 
What uses and benefits can IoT have for the financial services industry? 	I suspect that IoT will change the nature of financial services profoundly. You can think of an ATM machine as an early precursor. Over time, many aspects of financial services, from payment systems to the use of blockchain ledgers, will be mainstream.	Internet of Things 
Can IoT control the home?  	You might control some functions in a home. It might be heating and cooling, maintenance for appliances, security, looking after the garden, etc.	Internet of Things 
Which part of IoT will create the most jobs? Is it the developing part or hardware maintenance?  	If you have a good background and are adept at systems thinking, you will get your pick of what's available. IoT is not a bad area to grow your career.	Internet of Things 
How much does standardization play a role in IoT, and how can we take into consideration the needs of developing nations like India?  	Standardization is very important for adoption, for scale, and consequently for cost structure. Some of the standards bodies don't pay enough attention to the needs of developing nations, so it is crucial to have venues where technology can be localized to take into account practice, customs, markets, and economics at the right level.	Internet of Things
Is BlockChain centralized or decentralized? 	BlockChain are centralized as well as decentralized as opposed to the popular belief that BlockChains are decentralized. Private or centralized BlockChain mechanism has restricted entry to make changes to the ledger whereas in public or decentralized BlockChain anybody can have access to the ledger(Bitcoin, Ripple etc.)	BLOCKCHAIN
What is a Merkle Tree? 	Merkle Tree is used to verify the transaction in the quickest time and less space complexity.	BLOCKCHAIN
What is Elliptic curve cryptography Digital signature algorithm? 	When a transaction occurs in a BlockChain the first step is to hash each transaction in the memory pool using SHA256.These hashes are then placed into a Merkle Tree (hash tree).The hashes of transactions are grouped into two and then concatenated result is hashed again until the tree is formed.	BLOCKCHAIN
Why ECC is better than RSA? 	Hash at the top of the tree is called the Merkle root.The Merkle Root of this hash tree is placed into the block's header along with the hash of the previous block and a random number called a nonce.The block's header is then hashed with SHA256 producing an output that will serve as the block's identifier.	BLOCKCHAIN
What is a ledger? 	ECDSA is a cryptographic algorithm used by Bitcoin to ensure that the legitimacy of the transaction.It works on the principle of ECCDLP (elliptic curve cryptography discrete logarithmic problem) which means it is easy to go from A'>B but almost impossible to go from B'>A i.e ECC is a trapdoor function.	BLOCKCHAIN
What is the difference between Blockchain and distributed ledger? 	ECC and RSA both algorithms work on the principle of asymmetric encryption.In asymmetric encryption, there is a public key for encryption and private key for decryption. ECC is better than RSA because it provides equivalent security for a much lesser key size which makes ECC faster and more secure.As for equal key size, ECC would be more secure than RSA.	BLOCKCHAIN
Wt is Quorum Slice?	A ledger is typically a database.The blockchain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the blockchain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender.	BLOCKCHAIN
What is a segment tree? 	Ledgers can be centralized or decentralized depending on public or private BlockChain.	BLOCKCHAIN
What is Diffie Hellman key exchange? 	A distributed ledger is a database that is spread across several nodes or computing devices which are in layman terms the miners who run the algorithm on their computing devices. Every node copy and saves an identical copy of the ledger. Each participating node of the network updates itself independently.	BLOCKCHAIN
How are boxes linked in a BlockChain? 	The most striking feature of distributed ledger technology is that the ledger is not maintained by any central authority. Updates to the ledger are independent and done by each node. The nodes then vote on the update(transaction) to ensure that the majority agrees with the conclusion. This voting and agreement on one copy of the ledger is called consensus and is executed by a consensus algorithm.	BLOCKCHAIN
Write a python program to perform word tokenization? 	BlockChains are only a form of distributed ledger technology. Every distributed ledger doesn't use a chain of blocks to provide a secure and valid distributed confidenceA BlockChain is distributed and is managed by peer-to-peer networks. Since it is a distributed ledger, it can exist without a centralized authority or server managing it, and its data quality can be maintained by database replication and computational trust. 	BLOCKCHAIN
Write a function to calculate multiplicative inverse of two numbers? 	The structure of the BlockChain makes it distinct from other kinds of distributed ledgers. Data on a BlockChain is grouped together and organized in blocks. The blocks are then linked to one another and secured using  ECC cryptography. 	BLOCKCHAIN
Which of these facts about a ledger is NOT CORRECT? 	A quorum is the number of nodes required to reach agreement within a system. FBAs instead use "quorum slices". A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum, which can convince another specific node to agree.	BLOCKCHAIN
Which benefits of a BlockChain enabled business network engender TRUST? 	Segment Tree is a basically a binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments. The underlying principle behind this data structure is to store certain values of ranges as a balanced binary tree and hence query and update can be performed efficiently. 	BLOCKCHAIN
What is bitcoin	Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm used to exchange a secret key between two parties. It is used in symmetric encryption algorithms like AES	BLOCKCHAIN
What is the core requirement(s) for a business BlockChain? 	Boxes are linked backward to the previous block in BlockChain.Genesis block is the first block of the BlockChain.A block can never have more than one parent block.	BLOCKCHAIN
The primary benefit of immutability is	import math import sys def convert(example):var3=[]for i inexample:i=i.lower() var3.append return var3 P=input("Enter the Message") x=convert(P) print(x)	BLOCKCHAIN
A smart contract is	def multiplicative(e, phi): d = 0;x1 = 0;x2 = 1;y1 = 1;temp_phi = phi;while e > 0:temp1 = temp_phi/e temp2 = temp_phi " (temp1 * e); temp_phi = e;e = temp2;x = x2-(temp1* x1);y= d "( temp1 * y1);x2 = x1;x1 = x;d = y1;y1 = y;if (temp_phi ==1):return d + phi;	BLOCKCHAIN
In a business BlockChain, transactions	A ledger is used purely for the reporting of cash.	BLOCKCHAIN
What is the appropriate use of business BlockChain? 	Consensus, provenance, immutability, and finality.	BLOCKCHAIN
What makes a good Block Chain use case? 	An unregulated censorship resistant shadow currency.	BLOCKCHAIN
What factors can help ensure a successful FIRST BlockChain use case project? 	Technical services, business services, and solution.	BLOCKCHAIN
What do you understand by "burning of tokens" 	Tamper-proof	BLOCKCHAIN
Can you explain me the difference between "contract address" and "owner address"? 	Business rules implied by the contract embedded in Block Chain.	BLOCKCHAIN
What are the best practices while writing the smart contracts? 	Cannot be modified, are added to the ledger with appropriate confidentiality and are endorsed by a subset of business network participants.	BLOCKCHAIN
What is ERC20 token? 	A more efficient transaction processing system across a business network.	BLOCKCHAIN
How my ethereum wallet works? 	An identifiable business network or business problem to be solved or the need for trust.	BLOCKCHAIN
How write a whole document in ethereum BlockChain? 	A limited scope and/or a smaller business network and/or scalable project that can grow participants and scenarios.	BLOCKCHAIN
Can I transfer ether from a wallet to smart contract directly without invoking a payable function? 	In its simplest form, burning a token means making the token permanently unspendable. There are a few ways of doing this, such as sending the tokens to a bogus address (an address with no known private key) so that the token is no longer usable.	BLOCKCHAIN
Name some Test Networks for ethereum? 	A contract address can never be accessed directly (no private key). If I write a contract, I can add a function that if the contract receives ethers that came not through a function (for example a deposit()-function) but were directly paid, that those ethers get returned to the payer. But if I do not add such a repay-/revert- function, the ethers would be lost in the wallet forever. They then can not even be accessed by the contract owner.	BLOCKCHAIN
Which IDE should we use for the development of the smart contracts? 	Never do the inconsistent naming Use the latest version of the solidity compiler. Consider using Solidity's require the function to express preconditions concisely. Try to keep the gas cost low as possible. Do the unit testing of the smart contracts using the Mocha Framework.  Try to use the "self-destruct " function at the end of the smart contract.	BLOCKCHAIN
Define BlockChain in the simplest words? 	ERC20 token is a set of standards that are defined in the Ethereum, they consist of 5 functions and 2 events that help the transfer of tokens and listening to events.Most of the ICOS are using the ERC20 token as a standard token.There have been several improvements in the ethereum network also known as EIPs which have increased the functions of tokens.	BLOCKCHAIN
Can you name some consensus algorithms? 	MyEtherWallet runs an Ethereum node, and enables RPC on that node. This allows the client-side web3 library to connect to their node, and request information such as balance, or submitting signed transactions.Further wise they make use of a library called ethereumjs-wallet, which allows you to convert a private key to an address (which is then used to request balances), and a library called ethereumjs-tx which can sign raw transactions with private keys.	BLOCKCHAIN
What are hash functions in BlockChain? 	Using IPFS is almost definitely the right approach, as writing data to the BlockChain is usually prohibitively expensive. Having stored the data in IPFS and got the hash back, you can read the data using ipfs.cat(document_hash).If you want to put a document in storage, you can convert it to bytes then store the bytes on the BlockChain, but you don't want to do this. Putting documents in the event logs may be somewhat less impossible but don't.	BLOCKCHAIN
What are some properties of hash functions? 	If you want to send ethers to smart contract you should define a payable function it could be the fallback function.otherwise, you will get an error.	BLOCKCHAIN
Why there is a transaction fee included in the transactions of bitcoin and where does it go? 	Ropsten test network, Kovan test network, Rinkeby test network.	BLOCKCHAIN
How will you define the mining? 	Generally we use the REMIX IDE which is present online, or we can use the Truffle for the development and testing of smart contracts.	BLOCKCHAIN
Can you name some details that are sent to the block of bitcoin? 	BlockChain is a distributed ledger, which has a shared database based on consensus algorithm.	BLOCKCHAIN
How do the public key and private key generation work? 	POW ( proof of work ) which bitcoin uses, POS ( proof of stake), DPOS ( Delegated proof at stake).	BLOCKCHAIN
Can you write a smart contract for "Hello Word" in solidity?	Hash functions take any string of fixed size ( 256 bits in this case ) and generate a fixed size alphanumeric string	BLOCKCHAIN
